General Description
===================
Welcome to my personal page!

Here you will find more detailed information about me. Basically I am a motivated Chilean astronomer working on exoplanets. Currently I work at the Universidad Cat√≥lica del Norte. I do research, teaching (undergraduate and graduate level), outreach and management. On a personal level I do sports, I am a computer science aficionado and much more. To see details about my me see above on the different sections. You can also contact me using social media (see the links here on my page as well).

I hope you enjoy finding out about me.
