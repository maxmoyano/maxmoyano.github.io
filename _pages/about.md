Welcome to my personal page!
<br/>
Here you will find more detailed information about me. I am a motivated Chilean astronomer working on exoplanets. Currently I am a Professor at the Universidad Cat√≥lica del Norte. I do research, teaching (undergraduate and graduate level), outreach and management. On a more personal level I do sports, I am a computer science aficionado and much more. To know more about me check the different sections on this page. You can also contact me using social media (see the links here on my page as well).
<br/>
I hope you enjoy your visit to my site.
